          <h2>The Tell Tale Heart</h2>
        </div>
        <p1>
          A narrator defends his sanity while describing the events of a murder
          he committed. He confesses to killing an old man, who caused the
          narrator no harm or wrongdoing, justifying the act because the old
          man's eye resembled a vulture's eye. The narrator continues to defend
          his sanity with the fact he took "careful" and "intricate" measures to
          commit this crime perfectly, down to hiding the old man's dismembered
          body parts under the floorboard. When the police come to the
          narrator's home to investigate, the narrator confuses his guilt as
          being able to hear the dead man's beating heart from beneath the
          floorboards, discouraging his sanity. The narrator confesses to the
          crime after convincing himself the officers could hear the heart
          beating.

          <h2>The Hunger Games</h2>
        </div>
        <p2>
          Under the control of the Capitol, every year 12 districts of Panem
          must select one boy and one girl from each district to fight to the
          death in the annual Hunger Games until there is only one victorious
          tribute. Katniss Everdeen is one of these unlucky tributes, and must
          use the love she has for her family and friends, as well as her skills
          in hunting and survival to win the games.

          <h2>The Maze Runner</h2>
        </div>
        <p3>
          Once a month, a teenager is sent into the Glade, trapped around a
          giant Maze that is set up with traps and seems impossible to escape
          through. Each person sent into the Glade has no memory from before
          they were sent in, nor do they know why they are there. Eventually,
          Thomas and the rest of those alive in the Glade go through dangerous
          measures to find an escape through the maze, all while figuring out
          who they really are and who put them there.

          <h2>Peter Pan</h2>
        </div>
        <p4>
          Peter Pan ran away to Neverland so he would never have to grow up. One
          night, he visits Wendy in London, along with all of her siblings, and
          he takes them to Neverland. He shows them the wonders of never growing
          up, but soon Wendy and her siblings show Peter and the lost boys why
          growing up and having a family that cares about you is so important.
          While battling the pirate, Captain Hook, who's hand was cut off by
          Peter Pan and is now on the prowl for revenge, Peter must get Wendy
          and the rest of them back to London, to their family and to safety.
